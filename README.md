## DEVELOPMENT ENVIORMENT USED:

### ANDROID STUDIO

#### DESCRIPTION : 

Android Studio is Android's official IDE. It is purpose-built for Android to accelerate your development and help you build the highest-quality apps for every Android device.

BENEFITS OF USING ANDROID STUDIO :

1.Apply Changes:

Android Studio's Apply Changes feature lets you push code and resource changes to your running app without restarting your app—and, in some cases, without restarting the current activity. This flexibility helps you control how much of your app is restarted when you want to deploy and test small, incremental changes while preserving your device's current state.

2.Intelligent code editor:

The code editor helps you write better code, work faster, and be more productive by offering advanced code completion, refactoring, and code analysis. As you type, Android Studio provides suggestions in a dropdown list. Simply press Tab to insert the code.

3.Fast and feature-rich emulator:
The Android Emulator installs and starts your apps faster than a real device and allows you to prototype and test your app on various Android device configurations: phones, tablets, Android Wear, and Android TV devices. You can also simulate a variety of hardware features such as GPS location, network latency, motion sensors, and multi-touch input.


## USER INTERFACE :

The whole concept of Android User Interface is defined using the hierarchy of View and ViewGroup objects. A ViewGroup is an invisible container that organizes child views. These child views are other widgets which are used to make the different parts of UI. One ViewGroup can have another ViewGroup as an child element as shown in the figure given below:

---> It is easy to learn and simple to use

---> It is open-source and free

---> It is secure, fast and powerful

---> It has a huge community support (tens of millions of developers)

---> Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs

---> As Java is close to C++ and C#, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa

## BACKEND USED :

### Firebase:

Firebase is one kind of NoSQL database. The Firebase database is just a big JSON object where you can store whatever you want inside. Unlike SQL there’s no schema for the database, no tables, no columns, it’s just a combination of key/value pairs.

Firebase is a mobile and web application development platform developed by Firebase, Inc. in 2011, then acquired by Google in 2014. As of March 2020, the Firebase platform has 19 products, which are used by more than 1.5 million apps.
